# Bust-a-Movie  
By: James Vuong 


## PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 
The project is to build a fully functional web application that aims to provide users with a movie search engine. Anyone can read content on the site, however an account is required for users who want to participate. All members can rate films, review films, and search for them with relevant keywords.All film-related metadata used on the website is supplied by The Movie Database (TMDB), an open source database. Bust-a-Movie will be using Node.js back-end for its technology stack. Node.js will be perfect for 
something like a movie search engine because of itâ€™s data streaming capabilities.

The front-end will be developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the front-end framework using React.js. The back-end will be developed using Node.js with MySQL as the database component. 


## Table of Contents:  
* **index.html**: This file is the landing page of Bust-a-Movie. It contains the root source code of the web application and includes the majority of the front-end functions and requirements. 

## Installation:  
To install this project, the user must install NodeJS, ReactJS, and MySQL on their local machine. 

## Usage:  
Once all the required packages have been installed, in order to execute the code, the user must 1) download the repository and 2) open the downloaded **index.html** file in their browser.
